# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/ "explain to anyone"), **without the help of Google**:

-   what steps do i need to learn how to learn?
-   What is the Feynman learning technique and how can I implement it?
-   What does it mean to own my own learning journey?
-   In what ways can I crack through if I don’t get it\*\*\*:)“
