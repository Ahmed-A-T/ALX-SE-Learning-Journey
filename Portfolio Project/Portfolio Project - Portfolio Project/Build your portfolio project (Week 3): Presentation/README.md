## The Presentation

You’ve done so much! You’ve come so far. The day to present your portfolio project is nearly here.

The presentation will consist of several parts:

-   A slidedeck made with Google Slides
-   Introduction of team members, and each person’s role
-   Story of how your project was inspired
-   Technology & Architecture
-   Core algorithms and code snippet
-   Discussion of process, collaboration and timeline
-   Challenge(s) overcome
-   Live Demo
-   Learnings about technical interests as a result of this project
-   Time to answer questions from the audience
-   Feedback and comments provided by technical staff, possibly alum guests

The length of time for a presentation will be 18 minutes

You will have 2 minutes setup, 8 minutes to present followed by 8 min Q&A.

Presentations take practice. The mid-week PLD will give you that opportunity! Come prepared to practice.

### 3\. Live Demo

mandatory

Score: 100.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)

For teams who are working on web apps, a live demo means that the presentation must load the deployed website during the presentation and demonstrate at least one of the key features.

For teams who are not working on a web application, please prepare a video of the application being used. This includes the Maze project.

Not all parts of the application need to be demonstrated. As an example, if a project required uploading a file and waiting for 30m to process the data, it is enough to show that the file can be uploaded and that there is output generated from a previous run that is representative of the eventual output.

Scoring will be as follows: 5/5 points for a functional, engaging demo 3/5 points for a simple demo 0/5 points for a demo that meets unworkable errors or failures
