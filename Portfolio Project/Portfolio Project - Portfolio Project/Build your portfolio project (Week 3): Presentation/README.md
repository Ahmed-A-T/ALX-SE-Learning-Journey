## 3\. Live Demo
> Your recorded video must include a demo of your application, whether deployed or presented from localhost.
> 
> **Demo Expectations:**
> 
> -   The recorded demo must showcase the application in use.  
>     
> -   At least one key feature must be demonstrated.  
>     
> 
> **Application-Specific Guidelines:**
> 
> -   **Web Applications:** The presentation must load the website and demonstrate at least one key feature in action.  
>     
> -   **Non-Web Applications (Including the Maze Project):** The video should showcase the application in action.  
    

**Hint:**
> 
> If a process takes too long (e.g., 30 minutes to process a file), you may instead:
> 
> -   Show that the file can be uploaded.  
>     
> -   Display output from a previous run that represents the final result.  
>     

**Scoring Criteria:**
> 
> -   **5/5 points**: Functional and engaging demo.  
>     
> -   **3/5 points**: Simple but functional demo.  
>     
> -   **0/5 points**: Demo contains unworkable errors or failures.
