# Last run!

Yes! the portfolio project of the Webstack specialization will be your last-major-project!

## Make your choice

You will have almost 2 weeks to develop your portfolio project - during this period you will be alone or by team - to create a fully functional web application.

Be before starting any coding, you will need to research and define the project.

This project is important:

-   Because it will end your pathway at ALX
-   It’s summarize the entire Back-end specialization
-   The weight of this project is important in your overall score
-   You can be as creative as you want
-   And the most important: **You should be proud of it** - it will be THE project to show off during interview

## Solo or by team?

Good question right?

The first question you should ask yourself is: **what I want to do?**

Front-end app? Mobile app? Back-end app? API service? e-commerce website? cloud platform for videos streaming? or better: a learning platform?

Don’t be afraid to work in a team - “more resources” means bigger project - but also more soft-skills.

Working solo is also fine - just don’t think too big or find quick-win to achieve your project.

## No idea?

Be creative doesn’t mean “create a web application that will make the world a better place” - no - it means: do what you really want: it can be applying concept your learn during the curriculum - it can be exploring a new technology (Go, Rails, etc.) - or make a clone of an existing platform (I was not joking about the learning platform or video streaming…)

Try to solve a problem or learn!

Also, a web application doesn’t only mean “Website”, it can also be just an API.

## Steps of this portfolio project

To end the curriculum, the portfolio project is split in 3 parts:

-   The pitch (this project)
-   The development

Ready? Go!

As mentioned in the beginning of this project, you have some questions to ask yourself:

-   👨💻 Solo or team 👩💻 👨💻 👩💻 👨💻?
-   What do I want to build?
-   How do I want to build it?
-   Is it possible to build it in less than 2 weeks?
-   Do I like what I’m doing?

When you know these answers, you will have to prepare a pitch:

-   Max 10min of pitch (please repeat to not go over)
-   Google slide presentation with:
    -   Name of the project
    -   List of team members
    -   Description of the project
    -   Learning objectives
    -   Technologies used
    -   Third services used if applicable
    -   Challenges already identified
    -   Schedule of work (by using [Trello](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/T8mJBmiyDQV3pUBGRAHPkA "Trello") or [Kanban board](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/w_T3skcYROD3tCTBMbIEvg "Kanban board") or other) - don’t forget that you have less then 4 weeks (27 days exactly)
    -   Mock-ups if applicable
-   Video Recording of one or more team members presenting the pitch (using the Google Slide presentation)

Please post your slides and the recording to your web-stack portfolio pitch here.
