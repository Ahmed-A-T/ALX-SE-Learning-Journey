Development is not a long quiet river, but it can be really fun!

Starting today, you are building **YOUR** project - be proud of it!

### 1\. Video Demo of your project

mandatory

Score: 100.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)

Alongside your project presentation, we require a short video demo, no longer than 8 minutes, that showcases the essential features of your project, illustrating how they all work together. This video should include a walkthrough of the slides you prepared in the previous task.

We’ve created a tutorial video to inspire you with our expectations. Think of it as an inspirational tool, **not a strict template**, designed to help you effectively showcase your brilliant work. Your creativity and individual touch will make your demo even more engaging.

A few points to consider while preparing your video:

-   **Maximum Video Duration**: The video should not exceed **8 minutes**, ensuring it is concise and engaging.
    
-   **Background Music**: If you include background music, ensure it’s **copyright-free** to avoid potential legal issues.
    
-   **Voice-Overs**: **Your voice-over is mandatory**. Ensure your voice is clear, audible, and not overshadowed by the background music.
    
-   **Recommended Tools**: We suggest using
    
    -   **Recording**: Zoom(record + screenshare), Loom, Camtasia, etc
    -   **Editing tools** such as: Filmora Wondershare, Camtasia for your video creation.
    -   **How to share**: YouTube (or, if blocked in your country, use a similar site), or a cloud storage service (G-drive, One-drive, etc). Submit the URL of your video. **Make sure your video is accessible to the public** - On YouTube, it’s fine to flag it as **“unlisted,”** but don’t flag it as **“private”**

**Please note that your project will not be considered complete without this video submission. It forms an integral part of your final project assessment.**

So, let’s see your creativity in action.

We are eagerly awaiting your presentations and demo videos.

Happy building,
