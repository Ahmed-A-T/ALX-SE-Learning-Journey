### GitHub Student Developer Pack

**Learn to ship software like a pro**

There's no substitute for hands-on experience. But for most learners, real world tools can be cost-prohibitive.

That's why we created the GitHub Student Developer Pack with some of our partners and friends: to give learners free access to the best developer tools in one place so they can learn by doing.
