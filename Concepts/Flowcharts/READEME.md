# Flowcharts

# What is a Flowchart?
> A flowchart is a type of diagram that visually represents a workflow or process using a set of symbols or icons to denote different actions/decisions/steps within the process with arrows showing the direction of the flow. Flowcharts are used across many different professions to help analyze, design, document, and/or manage a workflow or process.

# Why use a Flowchart?
> Similarly to pseudo-code, flowcharts provide another way of approaching and/or understanding a workflow. Another benefit is that, when done well, flowcharts can be understood by non-developers and by developers that do not know the language the process is written in.

# Flowchart Symbols
> This type of diagram is extremely versatile and is used across many professional fields. Due to the number of industries using flowcharts, many sets of symbols and styles have been created with a specific industry in mind. A good symbol set to use is the ISO 5807 symbol set, as they are well-known and often used in the technology industry.
