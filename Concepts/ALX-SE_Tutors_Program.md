👉🏾They can guide you through tricky concepts and give feedback on your project work.

## What Tutors Are Not?

**👉🏾They are not Mentors!**therefore it is not possible to ask them to validate your Portfolio Project

**👉🏾They are not here to give you answers** or complete your projects for you.

👉🏾Tutors are **not substitutes for your own learning** or hard work.

👉🏾Their presence is **not an excuse to find an easy shortcut to the completion of your Portfolio Project**. Doing so will lead to disciplinary action.
